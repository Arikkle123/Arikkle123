- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arikkle123
  I am a dedicated C++/C software developer and a challenge driven tech-enthusiast with excellent self-learning ability.
  Experienced in research, software developing, testing and maintenance. 
  Being the go-to person whenever help is needed, I believe that “problems are nothing but wake-up calls for creativity” (Gerhard Gschwandtner).
  Using my active listening and out of the box thinking, I am excited to tackle any challenge.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in low-level programming and infrastructure :)
